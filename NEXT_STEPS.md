# LexHOA - Next Steps

## Planning Complete ✅

Comprehensive planning documents have been created for the next phase of LexHOA development.

---

## What's Been Created

### 1. Product Roadmap
**Location:** `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md`

Complete roadmap covering:
- **Feature 1:** Document Library (public-facing document access)
- **Feature 2:** Annual Dues Management (quarterly tracking with proration)
- **Feature 3:** Payment Processing Integration (Authorize.Net with fee pass-through)

Includes:
- Technical requirements for each feature
- Implementation phases (3 phases, 10 weeks total)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and criteria
- Future enhancement ideas

### 2. Detailed Feature Spec: Document Library
**Location:** `.agent-os/product/feature-specs/document-library.md`

Comprehensive specification including:
- User stories for homeowners and board members
- Complete GraphQL schema for Document type
- UI/UX wireframes and layouts
- User flows for viewing and managing documents
- Acceptance criteria and testing plan
- Performance and accessibility requirements
- Rollout plan in 3 phases

---

## Recommended Development Order

### Priority 1: Document Library (2-4 weeks)
**Why First:**
- Lowest technical risk
- High user value (immediate utility)
- No external dependencies
- Good warmup for team
- Public-facing feature builds trust

**Next Actions:**
1. Review document-library.md spec
2. Create S3 bucket for documents
3. Update GraphQL schema with Document type
4. Build public `/documents` page
5. Build board upload interface

---

### Priority 2: Annual Dues Management (3-4 weeks)
**Why Second:**
- Foundation for payment processing
- Complex business logic needs time to validate
- Data migration considerations
- Must be solid before payments depend on it

**Next Actions:**
1. Review GraphQL schema design in roadmap
2. Define proration business rules with treasurer
3. Update schema with AnnualDue type
4. Build board management interface
5. Integrate with existing Profile balances
6. Test proration scenarios extensively

---

### Priority 3: Payment Processing (4-6 weeks)
**Why Third:**
- Highest risk (financial transactions)
- Depends on Annual Dues being in place
- Requires external account setup (Authorize.Net)
- Needs extensive testing

**Next Actions:**
1. Complete card and ACH sandbox settlement/return testing
2. Verify webhook delivery and reconciliation alerts
3. Complete PCI and IAM remediation checklist
4. Soft launch with board members
5. Production rollout

---

## Payment Processing Status

Authorize.Net is the selected processor. Card and ACH tokenization, payment creation,
signed webhooks, and scheduled reconciliation are implemented. Production rollout
depends on completing the current payment and security testing checklists.

### Alternative: Square
- Simpler setup
- 2.6% + $0.10 (slightly cheaper for cards)
- Better for in-person payments
- Less flexible API
- Consider for hybrid approach (in-person events + online)

## Technical Architecture Summary

### Document Library
```
User Request
  ↓
CloudFront (optional)
  ↓
S3 Public Bucket → Document
  ↓
AppSync GraphQL → DynamoDB (Document metadata)
```

### Annual Dues
```
Board Member Action
  ↓
AppSync Mutation → Create/Update AnnualDue
  ↓
DynamoDB → AnnualDue records
  ↓
Profile Balance Updates (when paid)
```

### Payment Processing
```
Homeowner → Accept.js tokenization
  ↓
Authorize.Net transaction
  ↓
Webhook → AWS Lambda
  ↓
AppSync Mutation → Create Payment + Update AnnualDue + Update Profile Balance
  ↓
DynamoDB → All records updated
  ↓
Email Receipt (SES)
```

---

## GraphQL Schema Updates Needed

### For Document Library
```graphql
type Document @model { ... }
enum DocumentCategory { ... }
```
See: `.agent-os/product/feature-specs/document-library.md`

### For Annual Dues
```graphql
type AnnualDue @model { ... }
# Includes quarterly tracking and proration fields
```
See: `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md`

### For Payments (Enhancement)
```graphql
type Payment {
  # Add new fields:
  paymentMethod: PaymentMethod # CARD, ACH, CHECK
  authNetTransactionId: String
  processingFee: Float
  totalPaid: Float # checkAmount + processingFee
  status: PaymentStatus # PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED
}

enum PaymentMethod {
  CHECK
  CARD
  ACH
  CASH
}

enum PaymentStatus {
  PENDING
  COMPLETED
  FAILED
  REFUNDED
}
```

---

## AWS Resources Needed

### Existing (Already Have)
- ✅ AWS Amplify project
- ✅ AppSync GraphQL API
- ✅ DynamoDB tables
- ✅ Cognito user pools
- ✅ S3 buckets (for existing assets)

### New (To Create)
- 📄 S3 bucket for public documents
- 💰 Lambda functions for payment processing
- 💰 Authorize.Net account (sandbox + production)
- 📄 CloudFront distribution (optional, for faster document delivery)
- 💳 SES configuration (for payment receipts)

---

## Estimated Costs (Monthly)

### Document Library
- S3 Storage: ~$0.01 (50MB)
- Data Transfer: ~$0.10 (assuming 1000 downloads/month)
- **Total: ~$0.11/month**

### Annual Dues
- DynamoDB: ~$0.25 (minimal reads/writes)
- **Total: ~$0.25/month**

### Payment Processing
- Processor fees: Passed to homeowner
- Lambda: ~$0.20 (minimal invocations)
- SES (email receipts): ~$0.10
- **Total: ~$0.30/month + processor fees (paid by homeowners)**

**Grand Total: ~$0.66/month additional costs**

## Questions to Answer Before Starting

### Document Library
1. ✅ What categories do we need? (Defined in spec)
2. ✅ Who can upload documents? (Board only)
3. ✅ Max file size? (25MB)
4. ✅ File types allowed? (PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX)
5. ⏳ Do we archive old versions? (Decision needed)
6. ⏳ Any documents to migrate now? (Need inventory)

### Annual Dues
1. ⏳ What is the current annual dues amount per property?
2. ⏳ Are all properties charged the same amount?
3. ⏳ How should proration work exactly? (Need treasurer input)
4. ⏳ When do we generate annual dues records? (January 1st each year?)
5. ⏳ Do we backfill historical data?

### Payment Processing
1. ✅ Processor selected: Authorize.Net
2. ✅ Offer ACH in addition to cards
3. ⏳ Should payment be optional or replace checks entirely?
4. ⏳ Who manages the Authorize.Net account? (Treasurer? President?)
5. ⏳ What bank account receives payments?
6. ⏳ Do we need recurring payment setup (auto-pay)?

## How to Use This Plan

### For AI Agents
All planning documents are in `.agent-os/product/`:
- `roadmap.md` - High-level feature roadmap
- `feature-specs/document-library.md` - Detailed document library spec
- More specs to be created for Annual Dues and Payment Processing

When starting a new feature:
1. Read the relevant spec from `.agent-os/product/feature-specs/`
2. Follow AgentOS standards in `.agent-os/standards/`
3. Create feature branch using `.agent-os/instructions/start-feature.md`
4. Execute tasks using `.agent-os/instructions/execute-task.md`

### For Development Team
1. Review planning docs
2. Ask questions and clarify requirements
3. Get stakeholder signoff on priorities
4. Start with Document Library (lowest risk, high value)
5. Use AgentOS git workflow for branching

---

## Success Indicators

By the end of all three features, we should see:
- ✅ 50% reduction in document request emails
- ✅ 100% of properties have accurate annual dues tracking
- ✅ 60% of homeowners using online payments within 6 months
- ✅ Reduced administrative burden on treasurer
- ✅ Faster payment processing and reconciliation
- ✅ No security incidents
- ✅ High user satisfaction scores
