# ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED FOLDER - DO NOT USE

This folder is **auto-generated by AWS Amplify CLI** and should **NOT** be imported or modified.

## Important

- **DO NOT** import GraphQL queries from this folder
- **DO NOT** delete this folder (it will regenerate)
- **DO NOT** manually edit files here

## Where to Write GraphQL

Use the `src/queries/` folder for all GraphQL operations:
- `src/queries/queries.js` - Query operations
- `src/queries/mutations.js` - Mutation operations
- `src/queries/userQueries.js` - User-specific queries
- `src/queries/userMutations.js` - User-specific mutations

## Why This Exists

AWS Amplify CLI generates this folder when running:
- `amplify push`
- `amplify codegen`

The generated code is not used in this application. We maintain our own GraphQL operations in `src/queries/` for better control and organization.
